# Workout Plan & Fitness Regimen

My topic will include the workout plan I currently do (sometimes modified). I enjoy working out and I think it would be great to build a page based on my current hobbie and passion. I consider myself a health nut and like the idea of taking care of myself mentally, emotionally, and physically. Therefore this project topic will involve information regarding working out, nutrition, and self-care. 

## Why I Chose This Topic

I chose the topic of a workout plan because maintaining physical fitness is an essential part of living a balanced and healthy lifestyle. Exercise not only improves physical strength, endurance, and flexibility, it also supports mental health by reducing stress and boosting mood. A well-structured workout regimen helps individuals stay disciplined, track progress, and achieve personal health goals—whether that’s building muscle, losing weight, or improving overall stamina. I was also inspired by how fitness can be customized for people of all skill levels, making it an inclusive and empowering topic for anyone wanting to better themselves physically and mentally.

How to stay motivated and tips to continue workout plan. Maintenance of workouts.

Staying consistent isn’t about perfection and thinking that I am doing the workout as hard as I can. It’s about showing up, even on days when I don’t feel motivated. The important part is that I get up and move my body and break a decent sweat. Every workout, no matter how small, brings me closer to my goals. I have to trust the process, and be proud of every step I take forward and improve my health for myself and my future. This will also teach me self-discipline which I can also apply onto other aspects of my life.

## Updates
- I used flexbox on body, main, and article elements using the display: flex and column based layout. This helps to resize even on smaller screen. 
- I used grid on the benefits list as well as the footer for styling.
- new subpage is the stress management which relates to recovery. I wanted to further emphasize healthy habits especially when trying to implement consistent workout routines.
- image optimization was added so that it can also resize based on the browser and screen size as well.
