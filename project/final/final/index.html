                <h5>Different Types of Exercises</h5>
                <strong>Yoga:</strong>
                    <p>Yoga is a mind-body practice that combines physical postures, controlled breathing, and meditation. It improves flexibility, balance, and mental relaxation while also strengthening the body through controlled movements and poses.</p>
                <strong>Strength:</strong>
                    <p>Strength training involves exercises that use resistance (such as weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight) to build and strengthen muscles. It improves muscle mass, bone density, and overall physical power.</p>                    
                <strong>Cardio (Cardiovascular Exercise)</strong>
                    <p>Cardio exercises are activities that increase your heart rate and breathing for an extended period. They strengthen the heart and lungs while burning calories. Examples include running, cycling, swimming, and brisk walking.</p>                   
                <strong>Stretching/Flexibility</strong>
                    <p>Stretching involves gentle movements that lengthen muscles and increase the range of motion in your joints. Flexibility exercises help prevent injuries, reduce muscle tension, and improve posture and mobility.</p>
