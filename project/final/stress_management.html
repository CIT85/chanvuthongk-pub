            </figure>
            <p>Rest days, quality sleep, and stress management are just as important as lifting weights or doing cardio.
                Without recovery, your body cannot rebuild muscle, restore energy, or keep your mind focused and
                motivated.</p>
                
            <section>
                <h2>Why Rest Days Matter</h2>
                <p>Rest days give your muscles time to repair the tiny tears created during strength and cardio workouts.
                    This healing process is what makes you stronger over time. Taking at least one rest day per week
                    can help:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce the risk of overuse injuries.</li>
                    <li>Prevent burnout and extreme fatigue.</li>
                    <li>Keep workouts feeling enjoyable instead of like a chore.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Sleep and Muscle Recovery</h2>
                <p>Sleep is when your body does most of its “behind-the-scenes” repair work. During deep sleep,
                    hormones are released that support muscle recovery, immune function, and overall health.</p>
                <h3>Simple Sleep Guidelines</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aim for <strong>7-9 hours</strong> of sleep most nights.</li>
                    <li>Keep a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends.</li>
                    <li>Limit screens (phones, tablets, TVs) 30-60 minutes before bed.</li>
                    <li>Create a relaxing routine such as stretching, reading, or journaling.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Managing Stress on a Fitness Journey</h2>
                <p>High stress can make it harder to stick to your workout schedule and may impact sleep, energy,
                    and mood. Adding a few simple stress-management tools can support both your mental health and
                    your physical progress.</p>

                <h3>Stress-Management Ideas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mindful walks:</strong> Take a short walk outside and focus on your breathing and surroundings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gentle stretching or yoga:</strong> Use light movement on rest days to release tension.</li>
                    <li><strong>Breathing exercises:</strong> Try slow, deep breaths for 1-2 minutes when you feel overwhelmed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Journaling:</strong> Write down how you feel before and after workouts to notice patterns.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Quick Rest-Day Ideas</h2>
                <p>Rest days do not have to mean doing “nothing.” They can include low-intensity activities that help
                    you feel refreshed and ready for your next workout.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Light stretching or foam rolling.</li>
                    <li>A relaxing walk with a friend or pet.</li>
                    <li>Meal prepping for the week.</li>
                    <li>Listening to music or a podcast while you tidy your space.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Balancing workouts with rest, sleep, and stress management keeps your fitness journey sustainable
                    and enjoyable in the long run.</p>
